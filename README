This is a library that I made when I was in highschool for experimenting with number systems.

The quality of this code is actually decent. It has working tests which all pass.

Introduction:

Hanoi is a C99 library for exotic binary based number systems. It is named after the tower of Hanoi puzzle, which is itself an exotic number system. It includes a Python/C++ based testing library with python reference implementations.

Supported number systems:
- Negabinary (base -2)
- Binarions (base -1+i) (See: "A binary system for complex numbers" - Walter Penney)
- Base Fibonacci
- Stern-Brocot rationals

Intended use:

Hanoi is designed to have implemenations that are above all correct. 

To reduce the amount of detail sensitive code, operations with supported number systems are not implemented. Instead, the user is meant to perform calculations using non-exotic representations and then convert to an exotic number system only when the representation matters.


To compile, run:

$ make

Once you've compiled, run the tests:

$ ./run.sh
